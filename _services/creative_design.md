<h4>Mobile devices account for over 40% of worldwide website traffic, and if your site isn’t mobile-friendly, you may be losing out on valuable traffic from search engines. Many search engines like Google or Bing penalize sites that aren’t mobile-friendly and often push them lower in search results. However, retrofitting your current website isn’t as difficult as you may think, and Geepm is here to provide a low-cost, shortened timeline option that could be right for you.</h4>

<h3>What exactly does a mobile-friendly website look like?</h3>

<p>Websites that are mobile-friendly use responsive design to scale the text, page layout, and image size to be optimized for devices of different sizes. To see this in action, try resizing your current browser to be narrow like a mobile device. Notice how the layout is rearranged, font sizes change, and the navigation becomes a hamburger icon? This is what responsive design looks like.</p>
