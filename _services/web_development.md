<h4>Leveraging modern approaches to web development, we bring front-end, back-end, and architecture together to meet your business needs.</h4>

<p>We build applications that work for your business and your users. Whether it’s a complex enterprise platform and data storage, a responsive web app, or a marketing site, our web solutions function smoothly and deliver a consistent experience to users across all platforms.</p>

<h3>Planning for the Future State of Your Business</h3>

<p>A successful web development strategy looks at not only what your business’s technology footprint looks like today, but what you’d like it to look like in a future state as well. Our solutions architects and web development teams work alongside you early on in your MentorMate engagement to pinpoint exactly how you expect your business to evolve. Then, we strategically lay out a roadmap and identify what role technology plays in achieving your business objectives.</p>

<h3>The Invisible Force Behind Your Product</h3>

<p>The back-end of your web solution is everything that happens behind the scenes. While not visible, it’s arguably the most critical piece of the software puzzle. If not developed properly, the entire system won’t function smoothly. Highly-skilled in all modern back-end technologies and languages, our team develops innovative web solutions that run exactly as intended. And in some cases, better! If we encounter an issue during development or have an idea to improve your solution, we won’t be shy. We’ll let you know the best possible way to solve the problem.</p>

<h3>Now Playing: A Seamless Front-End Experience</h3>

<p>If back-end is everything that happens behind the scenes, front-end is what happens on stage. A successful front-end balances thoughtful design and seamless functionality to create a smooth experience when users view and interact with your product. Our front-end development team knows how to deliver exactly that. Well-versed in the best practices of all modern front-end tools and platforms, we work smartly and efficiently to deliver a world-class front-end experience to your users.</p>

<h3>Testing Your Web Product to Ensure Success</h3>

<p>Versed in comprehensive testing best practices, our quality assurance analysts work with your team to identify, fix, and prevent software quality issues. We use our own mix of manual testing, compatibility testing, performance testing, automation engineering, and continuous integration. We also offer a standalone software quality assessment by performing QA assessments and planning required improvements of the quality assurance process.
